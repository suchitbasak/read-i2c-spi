# Reading data from a few sensors

Using circuitpython to read sensor data without using sensor-specific libraries. I've picked sensors that I have previously used while designing boards and/ or I have breakout boards for.

Sensors picked for far:
- Temp sensor: AHT20
- Temp sensor: WSEN HIDS
- IMU: BMI088
